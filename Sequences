Sequence is a database object which is useing to automatically generates sequence number automatically.
Generally sequence are used to generates primary key values automatically.
Once sequence creates No of user simultaneously access.
Sequence is a independent database object.

Syntax:

      create sequence *sequence_name*
      start with *starting_value*
      increment by *increment_value*
      minvalue *minimum_value*
      maxvalue *maximum_value*
      cycle/nocycle
      cache/nocache;
      
Example:
      
      create sequence s1
      start with 1
      increment by 1
      minvalue 1
      maxvalue 100
      cycle/nocycle
      cache/nocache;

* if we can describe sequence values with character values then get error.
   
   
Example:

        create sequence s1
        start with 'one'
        increment by 'one'
        minvalue 'one'
        maxvalue 'five'
        nocycle
        nocache;

 ORA-01722: invalid number

-> if we want to generate sequence value or access sequence value then we are using following 2 pseudo columns
these are:

1)currval
2)nextval
