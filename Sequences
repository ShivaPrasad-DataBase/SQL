Sequence is a database object which is useing to automatically generates sequence number automatically.
Generally sequence are used to generates primary key values automatically.
Once sequence creates No of user simultaneously access.
Sequence is a independent database object.

Syntax:

      create sequence *sequence_name*
      start with *starting_value*
      increment by *increment_value*
      minvalue *minimum_value*
      maxvalue *maximum_value*
      cycle/nocycle
      cache/nocache;
      
Example:
      
      create sequence s1
      start with 1
      increment by 1
      minvalue 1
      maxvalue 100
      cycle/nocycle
      cache/nocache;

* if we can describe sequence values with character values then get error.
   
   
Example:

        create sequence s1
        start with 'one'
        increment by 'one'
        minvalue 'one'
        maxvalue 'five'
        nocycle
        nocache;

 ORA-01722: invalid number

-> if we want to generate sequence value or access sequence value then we are using following 2 pseudo columns
these are:

1)currval
syntax:squence_name.currval;
2)nextval
syntax:squence_name.nextval;

this pseudo statments also using in DML Operations.

in oracle if we want to check the sequence values then we must use dual table.

ex:

   create sequence s2
   start with 100
   increment by 5
   minvalue 110
   maxvalue 190
   nocycle
   nocache;
 
 select s2.currvalue from dual;
 error: sequence s2.currvale is not yet defined in this session
 * In oracle we want to generate first sequence number then we must use nextval pseudo column, 
 because currval pseudo column return current value of the sequence. 
 If sequence session already having a value
 
 select s2.nextval from dual;
 110
 select s2.nextval from dual;
 115
 .
 .
 .
 .
 select s2.nextval from dual;
 190
 select s2.nextval from dual;
 error :
