Locking is a mechanism which previents unautharized access for our resource.
they are two levels of locks
1)Row level
2)Table Level

1)Row Level:
->oracle 6.0 introduced row level locks.
-->in this method we are locking set of rows by using for update clause.this clause is used in select statement only.
 syntax:
           select * from table_name where condition for update[nowait]
           
 Note:
 ----
 whenever we are performaing locks then another user query the data but they cont performance DML operations and also in all databases whenever we using
 commit or rollback then automatically locks are released.
 
 ex: 
 session 1
 
 conn scott/tiger
 select * from emp where deptno=100 for update;
 commit;
 [for releasing locks]
 
 
 session 2
 conn shiva/shiva
 update scott.emp set sal=sal+100 where deptno=10;
 [we cannot perform DML]
 
 nowait:
 ------
 nowait is an optional clause using with along aptional clause whenever we are using this clause then 
 oracle server automatically return controlled the current session.
 
 if another user not rekeasing loacks also in this case oracle server returns an error ORA-00054:resource busy
 
 
 session 1
 
 conn scott/tiger
 
 select * from emp where deptno=10 for update nowait;
 ora-00054:resourcebusy
 
 session 2
 
 conn shiva/shiva
 
 select * from scott.emp where deptno=10 for update
 
 
 table level locks:
 ----------------
 table level locks only handle by DBA only
 in this method we are locking a table. Oracle having following level of locks:
 1)share lock
 2)exclusive lock
 
 1)share lock:
 whenever we are using this lock then another user query the data but they can perform DML operations and also at a time no.of users lock the resource.
 
 syntax:
 lock table table_name in share mode;
